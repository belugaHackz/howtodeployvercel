# howtodeployvercel
This is a tutorial on how to deploy different git repository to vercel.com, including a game website for you made by me using canva

There are many ways to deploy apps/games to vercel as a static website. The main way to deploy is usually a black "deploy to vercel" button somewhere hidden in the readme file
Many people have complained that there is no deploy button, and today im here to solve this issue that most everyone has.

Not all repositories have a tutorial on how to do this, i'm here to solve that. Up in the top right corner of this post, you will see a fork button, including a dropdown next to it along with some other extra buttons. Click on the fork button. Once the button is pressed, it should bring up a customization screen

Simply put in what you want the domain to be *NO SPACES* and it will then take you to the next screen where it shows all of the files. Go to vercel.com, and click on "Add new".

You will be then prompted with different choices. Click project. It will open another screen. Type in your forked project, for instance if i had typed in "galactic", i would type that in there. You should see the repository once searched. Click on the button beside it, bringing you to another screen

Type in what you want the domain to be; this will be the website URL for your website. Once done, you can continue with the steps. DO NOT PRESS ANY OTHER BUTTONS!!! These are root certificates and are needed for the site itself to function. Modifying any of these could destroy your site. 

You may now click deploy. It should auto scroll and show thats it building. For you it might be very fast. It might not work saying there is a problem with the script and it will report it over to the vercel team. Verify what your deploying can deploy as a site. This means you should click one of the folders, and if there is something like index.html, that is your website code. If not, please place an issue under the repository. 

If you have any issues, please let me know by pressing the Issues tab and typing your issue. 

Here is the game website as promised: g4u.my.canva.site
I personally created it, we have daily updates, proxies, and ways to remove lanschool, go guardian, Zscaler, and more! Please leave a good review about us at the bottom of the page. We might have days where it says the site is down. Its common because we are the center of an attack on going and we keep getting hacked. We will try our best to maintain the site and keep it up. This isn't promised, considering we are under attack by an organization who does not agree with our website and the games.

I hope this tutorial went well for everyone, and i hope you have a good day. Have fun!
