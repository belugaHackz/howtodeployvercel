404 ERROR CODE

I cannot tell you how many times i see this on any sites i've deployed. It's an easy fix though

Click on your settings in vercel on the site and be sure that under Build & Development Settings that everything is registered correctly. If it says Other with a blank triangle,
this is not needed.
